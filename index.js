/*

->fucntional programming language and lambda langauge
->loosely and dynamically typed: 
Eg: var a=5;
    we dont write int,float,char that is why we call it as loosely typed language
    var a="hello";
    we have change the data type of the a variable when we compiled it will dyanmically change the 
    the datatype to string.
     

Data types
    1. Number
    2. string
    3. Boolean
    4 Undefined
    5.Null


    Eg: var a=10;
    var b="hello";
    var c=true;

    Null in js means there is no value.
    we have to assign NUll value to it::: var null_vari=null;
    Undefined in js means we didn't define value.

var a = 10;
var b = "hello";
var c = true;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);
